How would you transmit a vast, unbounded virtual universe, like the Oasis fictionalized in Ready Player One, to users?  This video, and the associated proofs of concept, demonstrate an approach to that end.

## Proofs of Concept

Below are two proofs of concept that each feature a first-person and third-person point of view.  You will be able to see geometry popping into view in the third-person view, but this should never be visible in the first-person view.

### Privacy Statement

The software distributed through this website will never collect any data nor require any permissions other than internet access to query geometry from the server.

### The New Proof of Concept

The new proof of concept is available for Windows, Linux, MacOS (read below), and Android.  There is no plan for an iOS release.  Your hardware must be **OpenGL 2.1** compatible.

#### Additional Android Distributors

Note that the .apk downloaded from these sources will not have the Android hash value given above.

[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buildtheoasis.city)<br>
[Amazon Apps](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DLKBTS8/)

#### Attention MacOS Users

The .zip file should work like a .dmg.  However, it is not digitally signed, and the developer is not registered with Apple (i.e. doesn't pay their fees).  If you want to run the software, you might need to [override Gatekeeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatekeeper_(macOS)).  The developer does not offer support for doing this.

### The Old Proof of Concept

This Three.js-based demo should work with any modern web browser (not Internet Explorer) that supports WebGL.  Visit the assocated GitHub [repository](https://github.com/kalbfled/jit-geometry) for the source code and a discussion of limitations.

## Contact

The developer desires to work with game makers to test the scalability and commercial potential of this method.  You can contact him [here](https://www.davejk.me/contact/).
